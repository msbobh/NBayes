## Description

A naive Bayes classifier is a simple probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions. A more descriptive term for the underlying probability model would be "independent feature model".

In simple terms, a naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence (or absence) of a particular feature of a class is unrelated to the presence (or absence) of any other feature, given the class variable. In spite of their naive design and apparently over-simplified assumptions, naive Bayes classifiers have worked quite well in many complex real-world situations.

This class implements a discrete (integer-valued) Naive-Bayes classifier. There is also a special named constructor to create classifiers assuming normal distributions for each variable. For arbitrary distribution classifiers, please see NaiveBayes<TDistribution>.
